# Covid-19-DataViz-Challenge

_In this tutorial we aim to create an interactive world map that shows the movie-production counts upon country-specific mouse-hover. This is done using D3 (v3)._
This assignment has been done in place of the mid-term exam in Information Visualization (CS5346). The task is aimed at creating visualisations to gain useful insights about the pandemic. All the visualisations have been created purely in D3

To reproduce my results:
1. Setup a server on your local machine using python. In the src directory run:  
  <pre><code>python -m http.server 8080
</code></pre>

2. Open up amy html files in any folder in your preferred browser to interact with it.
